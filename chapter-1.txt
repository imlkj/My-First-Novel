**Chapter One: The Spark**

The rain hammered against the cobblestone streets, transforming the city into a canvas of shimmering lights and blurred edges. In the heart of the chaos, Alina sprinted through the narrow alleyways, her breath clouding the damp air. Clutched tightly in her hand was a small leather-bound book, its spine worn and edges singed—a relic that could unravel everything.

Her pursuers were close. She could hear their boots slapping against puddles, their shouts echoing off the walls. The Black Cloaks were relentless, their orders clear: retrieve the book, and eliminate the thief...

Alina ducked into a shadowed alcove, pressing her back against the cold stone wall. Her heart pounded as she tried to steady her breathing. The book pulsed faintly in her hand, almost alive. She had no idea why the artifact was so important, only that she couldn’t let it fall into their hands. The old woman in the marketplace had been clear: *"Guard it with your life, child. It’s the key to everything."*

A Black Cloak passed mere feet away, his torch casting flickering light across the alley. Alina held her breath, counting the seconds until he moved on. When the sound of his footsteps faded, she slipped back into the shadows, her mind racing.

The city of Emberfall had always been a dangerous place for someone like her—a street rat with no family, no home, and nothing to lose. But tonight was different. Tonight, she had something to protect.

Reaching the edge of the alley, Alina glanced up at the clock tower that loomed over the city square. Midnight. The meeting point was only a few streets away, but getting there would mean crossing the open plaza—a risk she couldn’t afford.

She’d barely taken a step when a hand clamped down on her shoulder. Alina spun around, dagger in hand, only to meet the piercing green eyes of Kael, a familiar face she hadn’t expected to see.

“Still as jumpy as ever,” he said, releasing her shoulder. His voice was low, calm, but his gaze darted to the book in her hand. “Do you even know what you’re carrying?”

“No,” Alina admitted, pulling the book closer to her chest. “But it’s worth dying for.”

Kael’s smirk faded, replaced by a grim seriousness. “Let’s hope it’s not your life we’re talking about.” He glanced over his shoulder. “We need to move. Now.”

Together, they darted through the labyrinth of Emberfall’s backstreets, the rain masking their movements. Alina couldn’t shake the feeling that the book was more than just an artifact. It felt like a ticking clock, counting down to something she couldn’t yet understand.

By the time they reached the abandoned chapel on the outskirts of the city, her legs burned and her lungs ached. Kael pushed open the heavy wooden doors, and they stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of damp wood and decay.

“You’re late,” a voice said from the shadows. A tall figure emerged, cloaked and hooded, their face obscured. “Do you have it?”

Alina hesitated, her grip tightening on the book. She looked at Kael, who gave a subtle nod.
